## K- Nearest Neighbours
KNN is a supervised learning algorithm which is used for classification and regression as well
KNN in classification - KNN classifies input by votes of its K nearest neighbours.
KNN in regression - KNN gives output by taking the average values of the K nearest neighbours.

## SVM- Support Vector Machine
In machine learning, support-vector machines (SVMs, also support-vector networks) are supervised learning models with associated learning algorithms that analyze data used for classification and regression analysis.

## Multiple Linear Regression
Multiple linear regression, also known simply as multiple regression, is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. The goal of multiple linear regression is to model the linear relationship between the independent variables and dependent variable.


## Stochastic Gradient Descent
Stochastic gradient descent is an iterative method for optimizing an objective function with suitable smoothness properties. It is called stochastic because the method uses randomly selected samples to evaluate the gradients, hence SGD can be regarded as a stochastic approximation of gradient descent optimization

## Artificial Neural Network
An ANN is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain. Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit a signal from one artificial neuron to another. An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it.
